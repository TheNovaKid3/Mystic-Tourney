# Mystic-Tourney
A simplish rpg battle system created for my Python Final Project. Uses tkinter Guis to do most of everything.

There are currently 6 characters: Kanade, a kitsune; Siegfried, a dragon; Alice, A perfectly ordinary witch; Rupert Scarlet, a vampire; Daiyousei, a fairy; and Lena, a unicorn.

Each of the characters has a different battle style, whether it be incredibly tanky or inflicting status and taking advantge of those effects.
