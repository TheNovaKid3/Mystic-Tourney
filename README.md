# Mystic-Tourney
## Synopsis
A simplish rpg battle system created for my Python Final Project. Uses tkinter Guis to do most of everything.

There are currently 6 characters: Kanade, a kitsune; Siegfried, a dragon; Alice, A perfectly ordinary witch; Rupert Scarlet, a vampire; Daiyousei, a fairy; and Lena, a unicorn.

Each of the characters has a different battle style, whether it be incredibly tanky or inflicting status and taking advantge of those effects.

## A Quick Look
It's currently not very colorful but it works quite well in my opnion.

## How to run
To play this game you need a program which can run .py files. If you have one, you simply open MysticTourney.py and run it. When you run it the main menu should pop up. If you don not have one you can easily download IDLE.
## Motivation
I created this program mostly because I could and wanted to. I love video games and have always wanted to write for or program one before. And while this one might not have any kind of story (and no images of the characters), I still had a good time programming it and have an idea of what each of the characters look and act like and where a story staring them might go.
